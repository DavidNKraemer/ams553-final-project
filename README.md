directory for details. There you will see how to access various bits of data.

# TODOs

## Proposal

## Project

[ ] Implement a model of the k-drone tour in Python
[ ] Implement simulated annealing
[ ] Implement cross entropy method
[ ] lol, tests?
[ ] Implement some alternatives for calculating neighbors, measuring temperature probabilities, etc.
[ ] Statistical analyses of the input data
[ ] Statistical analyses of the results

## Presentation

[ ] lol, everything
