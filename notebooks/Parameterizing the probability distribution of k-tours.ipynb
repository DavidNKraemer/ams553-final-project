    "This is Algorithm 4.7.2 from Rubinstein and Kroese, *The Cross-Entropy Method: A Unified Approach to Combinatorial Optimization, Monte-Carlo Simulation, and Machine Learning* (2004). Given $n$ points in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we want to construct a TSP tour. Consider the point labels $[0,1,\\dots,n-1]$. It suffices to construct the tour on these labels. The idea from the book is as follows: suppose we have a discrete-time Markov chain on the labels with a transition probability matrix $P$. Starting from state $0$, draw the next state according to the distribution $P_{0, :}$. But in order to make sure that we don't accidentally choose $0$ again (invalid as a TSP tour), we negate the column $0$ and renormalize the entire matrix $P$. Then we proceed by drawing the next state. In general, given that we are at state $j$, we negate the $j$ column and renormalize $P$. Then we draw the next state from $P_{j,:}$. After we have done this $n-1$ times, we are finished, because we then must return to state $0$. In pseudocode, it resembles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define $P^{(0)} = P$. Let $j = 0$.\n",
    "2. Generate $X_j$ from the distribution formed by the $j$th row of $P^{(j)}$. Obtain the matrix $P^{(j+1)}$ from $P^{(j)}$ by first setting the $X_j$th column of $P^{(j)}$ to $0$ and then normalizing the rows to sum up to $1$.\n",
    "3. If $j = n-1$, stop. Otherwise, set  $j = j + 1$ and repeat 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Cross-Entropy method, we need to create a way to parameterize the class of probability distributions over the space of tours. While there is a natural way to do so when we assume at the outset that all tours are equally useful---and hence probable---for CE to work we need to be able to adjust the distribution so that it emphasizes the better-scoring tours. Introducing the transition probability matrix $P$ gives us exactly this feature. Now we can adjust the likelihood of drawing a given tour depending on how successful that particular tour shows itself to be during the simulation."

Again, for CE to work well, we need to be able to adjust the distribution over the space of $k$-drone tours so that as the simulation proceeds, better $k$-drone tours are given higher preference.

Given input of a transition probability matrix $P$ *and* a probabilty distribution on $[0, 1, \\dots, n-1]$ denoted $[p_0, \\dots, p_{k-1}]$, we proceed with the trajectory genreation but with a modification. First, we select $k$ starting positions according to the probabilitiy distribution on the labels. Next, before we determine the next step in tours, we roll a $k$-sided die. Whichever drone $i$ the die lands on, we perform Step (2) from the original algorithm. Then we proceed as before.\n",
